Most of his abilities are copies from Lord Kazzak, which is fitting since he is Kazzak's minion. He has yet to be observed using all of Kazzak's abilities.
`- Melee attacks: No heavy melee damage with his normal attacks (Probably 200-400 per hit)` ^3
`- Shadowbolt Volley [21341:  Shoots out a long range cluster of shadow bolts for around 2,000 damage. Even when out of line of sight players will still be hit.`
