# TBC-research

I am NOT part of Netherwing. I am not part of Crestfall. I am not affiliated with any servers or teams, I am making a suggestion for the community to change, and appealing to testers to publicize their research.

Research for several functionalities used in The Burning Crusade

Please create new issues and use this as an information dump. I (and hopefully some future contributors) will try to manage information as best as possible.
