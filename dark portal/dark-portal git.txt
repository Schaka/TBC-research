- [ ] **IMPORTANT -> WAVES UPDATE** (It might be more complicated system than just waves, something like timers etc. but the following is quite accurate)
_This is important to work on because right now there is overflow of Demons coming out from the Portal and it looks like 500% custom shit in compere to videos from retail_
**WAVING SYSTEM 2.0 (based on wave type)**:
`- It looks like mainly waves are formed based on Invading Felguards`
`- Wave: Invading Felguard + Felguard Lieutenant + Invading Fel Stalkers`
`- Wave: Invading Felguards + Invading Voidwalkers (1/2) + Invading Fel Stalkers`
`- Wave: Invading Felguards + Portal Hounds (they run past the barricades, aggroes in the camp)`
`- Worth noticing that probably Invading Infernal are only formed via meteor hits`
`- Dreadknight every X minutes, no matter what wave it is`
**WAVING SYSTEM 3.0 (based on timers and stages)**
`- Dreadknight every X minutes no matter what stage it is`
Fel Stalkers stage:
`- Invading Felguard are base of every "wave", they spawn the fastest (fx. 1.0 timer)`
`- Invading Fel Stalkers spawn rate (1.5)`
`- Felguard Lieutenant (5.0)`
Voidwalker stage:
`- Invading Felguard (1.0)`
`- Invading Voidwalker (1.5)`
`- Felguard Lieutenant (5.0)`
Portal Hounds stage:
`- Invading Felguard (1.0)`
`- Portal Hound (1.5)`
`- Felguard Lieutenant (5.0)`
Invading Infernals behaviour for System 3.0
`- they spawn in all stages due to them being meteor hit spawns`


- [ ] **IMPORTANT UPDATE ON DREADKNIGHT SITUATION**
`- It seems that there is a chance to Justinius the Harbringer, Lord Marshal Raynor or Melgromm Highmountain to not appear. In this case two Nethergarde Advisor should join the fight with Dreadknight leaving Watcher Theronus alone`
`- Sometimes there is wrong timing on yells for both Dreadknight and Heroes (spotted on Justinus, might be same with others)`

`- He should be using Monster - Staff, Ornate Mage Staff [2177]`
`- He should be friendly to Alliance and Horde players`
`- If Watcher Mahar Ba [5385] is using any abilities, they should share them`

- [ ] **Nethergarde Advisor**
`- They should be friendly to Alliance and Horde players`
`- Nethergarde Advisor should joing the Dreadknight fight, if it's up and there is no other Heroes (Justinius, Raynor or Melgromm) spawned`
`- They can be human only during the event (no proof for Gnome version)`
`- They should have dagger as a weapon and melee attack with it, if no mana for Fireball - Monster - Dagger Badass [2711]`
`- Should have ability called: Fireball`

- [ ] **Justinius the Harbinger / Lord Marshal Raynor / Melgromm Highmountain**
`- They should stay for a while after they kill Dreadknight and then go through the portal. (is it possible to make them go streight through the portal, not stoping in that waypoint in the bottom of the stairs?)`
`- Sometimes they spawn without their bodyguards (fix it!)`
`- It looks like they should ignore Portal Hounds in the camp and aggro only Invading Felguard, Felguard Lieutenant, Fel Stalker, Anguisher, Voidwalker, Infernal and Dreadknight`

- [ ] **Justinius the Harbinger**
`- He should be accompanied by 5 Vindicators`
`- He should use his Greater Blessing of Might [33564] on nearby allies when entering the field (don't know if only Alliance, or both Horde and Alliance) (sometimes he uses it and sometimes he doesn't)`
`- Missing random say: Yes! Hold your feet firm! Lend aid to your cohorts and together our banded strength will overcome these demons! Cling fiercely to hope and grip tightly your weapons, and trust that the Light will pierce this darkness and shine through to morrow's dawn!`
`- He should say this randomly instead of yell on spawn: With each passing moment, I see the people of Azeroth prove again the reasons we have come. It is with solemn pride that I fight with you, and if I die this day, then I die among friends.`
`- He should say this randomly instead of yell on spawn: The demons should be in no doubt that we are their nemesis and, though they wish our destruction, it is we who bring about their ruin. Kazzak and his forces will be diminished and defeated by this coalition. And to do this, we must throw at them our bodies and hearts, for they seek no less than the obliteration of this world.`

!IMPORTANT -> Works fine (just trigger should be closer do the portal, look below)
- [ ] **Lord Marshal Raynor and Gnomeregan Conjuror**
When Lord Marshal Raynor is about to spawn to fight with Dreadknight the following should happen:
`- Two Gnomeregan Conjurors spawn on trigger (I listed It below) - they should spawn with Dreadknight, so they have time to summon Lord Marshal Raynor`
`- Gnomeregan Conjurors should start to cast portal to Stormwind`
`- After a second or so, Lord Marshal Raynor goes out of the portal and creates formation with Stormwind Marshals`
`- Lord Marshal Raynor and Stormwind Marshals rush to the portal to fight Dreadknight together`

- [ ] **TRIGGER: https://youtu.be/21_YJ2uZBL0**
`- Trigger should be close to the portal, here:`
